# KASA - P11
## _This is an apartment rental platform_

## Tech

Tech used for creating this app:
- [REACT] 

## Purpose of the project 

The main objective of this project was to become familiar with **React** and more precisely to understand:
- **React Components**
- **React Hooks** [ useState, useEffect ]
- **React Router**


## How does this application work ?

In this app I have four pages, **HomePage**, **AboutPage**, **AppartmentPage** and **404Page**
.
I am using React Router to render components conditionally.
So by default the homepage is rendered but if we click the About link the about page will be rendered or if we click one of the appartements it will render the appartement page dynamically using the id
To display the apartments, I use a list of objects then I loop throughth this list for a dynamic and cleaner code
